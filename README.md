# MD Infant Mortality Analysis

![](Images/taylor-wright-Z-qcLHT0r_M-unsplash.jpg)

## Introduction

Infant Mortality is a growing issue in the United States especially among Black women. However, these disparities are multiplied when you examine it amongst other
social stratifications. Specifically, I examined race and geographic location to highlight the major disparities in infant mortality. Those from rural communities
and black women have a greater rate of infant mortality compared to other counties and racial groups. 


## Staring the Project and Goals

Data was retrieved from the Maryland State Health Department website. I was seeking data that showed racial disparities in infant mortality and geographic
disparities in infant mortality. From this, I created a data frame and a graphical visualization to compare both the racial and geographical disparities in 
infant mortality. The goal of this project is to visually display that Black women and their babies are at a substantially higher risk of dying compared to other
races. This is even more evident in the geographic differences in infant mortality rates. By creating this project, it will add to the discussion and education for 
improving complications and mortality rates among Black women and their babies.

### Status
The issue of infant mortality is still prevalent across the United States. Thus, this study can be expanded to compare across states and within communities. 
It can also be updated to compare infant mortalty rates based on income, education, and state programs.
